by a soldier who attacks them, while Joel is saved by his brother\\xa0Tommy. Twenty years later, Joel lives in the\\xa0Boston\\xa0quarantine zone managed by the Federal Disaster Response Agency (FEDRA) as a smuggler with his partner\\xa0Tess. When Tommy fails to contact them from his location in\\xa0Wyoming, they try to buy a car battery from a local dealer but it is instead sold to the Fireflies, a rebel group that opposes FEDRA. Attempting to retrieve it, they find the deal has gone awry and\\xa0Marlene, the Fireflies’ wounded leader, begs Joel and Tess to take young\\xa0Ellie\\xa0to the\\xa0Old State House\\xa0in exchange for supplies. They are caught by a soldier while sneaking out and Ellie stabs him when he tests them for infection. When the soldier tries to shoot her, Joel beats him to death. Tess realizes Ellie is infected, but Ellie promises them she will not turn. They enter a biological contamination area to flee the pursuing FEDRA soldiers.\\n* * *\\nHOST: And that’s your biggest worry?\\nDR.

Also a fungus.\\nViruses can make us ill, but fungi can alter our very minds.\\nThere’s a fungus that infects insects.\\nGets inside an ant, for example, travels through its circulatory system to the ant’s brain, and then floods it with hallucinogens, thus bending the ant’s mind to its will.\\nThe fungus starts to direct the ant’s behavior, telling it where to go, what to do, like a puppeteer with a marionette.\\nAnd it gets worse.\\n\\n\\n\\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\\n\\nThe fungus needs food to live, so it begins to devour its host from within, replacing the ant’s flesh with its own, but it doesn’t let its victim die.\\nNo, it… it keeps its puppet alive by preventing decomposition.\\nHow?

She sees a psychic vision of his bullies whom she attempts to kill in revenge but gets expelled. Her parents,\\xa0Morticia\\xa0and\\xa0Gomez, decide to enroll her in Nevermore Academy, a school for outcasts. Meanwhile, a hiker is killed by an unknown creature near Nevermore. Wednesday’s parents release\\xa0Thing, a sentient disembodied hand, to watch over her. She meets her roommate Enid, her complete opposite, and duels with Bianca, the popular girl, after she bullies another boy, Rowan. Later, Wednesday is nearly killed by a falling gargoyle but is saved by Bianca’s ex-boyfriend Xavier. After escaping her court-ordered therapy session, Wednesday meets Tyler, who agrees to help her escape from Nevermore. However, she is apprehended by principal Larissa Weems and taken back to the school. Later, Tyler and Wednesday meet at the local fair, and Wednesday has a vision of Rowan’s death.

The news shocks Princess Rhaenyra into a premature stillbirth. Prince Daemon, believing Viserys was murdered, urges war. Ser Erryk brings the late king’s crown and Rhaenyra is declared queen; all but Rhaenys swear allegiance. Ser Otto arrives to present Aegon’s terms for Rhaenyra’s concession; she prevents Daemon from killing Otto and delays answering. Privately, Daemon is angered by Rhaenyra’s desire to negotiate peace, dismissing the dream about the promised prince. Rhaenys persuades a still-recovering Lord Corlys to pledge House Velaryon’s allegiance to Rhaenyra’s “Black” faction; he proposes using his navy to blockade King’s Landing’s shipping lanes and Daemon plans to recruit more dragonriders; he awakens Vermithor, a dragon nearly as large as Vhagar. Rhaenyra sends Princes Jacaerys and Lucerys as envoys to secure Houses Arryn, Stark and Baratheon as allies. At Storm’s End, Lucerys encounters Prince Aemond, who is newly betrothed to Lord Borros Baratheon’s daughter; Borros refuses to support Rhaenyra. Aemond demands Lucerys’ eye as retribution; Lucerys refuses. He leaves on his dragon Arrax, then is pursued by Aemond on Vhagar. The fractious dragons resist their riders’ commands and Arrax burns Vhagar. Incensed, Vhagar kills Lucerys and Arrax, stunning Aemond. Daemon informs Rhaenyra of Lucerys’ death; she mourns and is enraged.\\n* * *\\n(epic theme playing)\\n♪ ♪\\n♪ ♪\\n(light music playing)\\n(wind blowing)\\n♪ ♪\\nPrincess Rhaenyra: There you are.\\nThe Sea Snake is going to die, isn’t he?\\nLuke…\\nI can’t be Lord of the Tides.\\nGrand sire was the greatest sailor who ever lived.\\nI get green sick before the ship even leaves the harbor.\\nI’ll just ruin everything.\\nI don’t want Driftmark.\\nIt should’ve passed on to Ser Vaemond.\\nWe don’t choose our destiny, Luke.

She sees a psychic vision of his bullies whom she attempts to kill in revenge but gets expelled. Her parents,\\xa0Morticia\\xa0and\\xa0Gomez, decide to enroll her in Nevermore Academy, a school for outcasts. Meanwhile, a hiker is killed by an unknown creature near Nevermore. Wednesday’s parents release\\xa0Thing, a sentient disembodied hand, to watch over her. She meets her roommate Enid, her complete opposite, and duels with Bianca, the popular girl, after she bullies another boy, Rowan. Later, Wednesday is nearly killed by a falling gargoyle but is saved by Bianca’s ex-boyfriend Xavier. After escaping her court-ordered therapy session, Wednesday meets Tyler, who agrees to help her escape from Nevermore. However, she is apprehended by principal Larissa Weems and taken back to the school. Later, Tyler and Wednesday meet at the local fair, and Wednesday has a vision of Rowan’s death. Rowan attempts to kill her but is murdered by the monster.\\n* * *\\n[jauntily macabre music playing]\\n[student laughing]\\n[heavy footfalls echoing]\\n[girl] I’m not sure whose twisted idea it was to put hundreds of adolescents in underfunded schools run by people whose dreams were crushed years ago… but I admire the sadism.\\n[heavy footfalls continue echoing]\\n[school bell rings]\\n[jocks guffawing]\\n[gags, whimpers]\\n[thud]\\nI want names.\\nI don’t know who they were, honest.\\nIt happened so fast.\\nPugsley, emotion equals weakness.\\nPull yourself together.\\n[whimpers]\\nNow.\\n[eerie whooshing]\\n[jocks jeering]\\n[jock] You scared, kid?
